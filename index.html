						I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Statistics and Environmental Economics. Although I think that conserving the environment for the betterment of the human race in the long term is incredibly important, Statistics definitely beat out as a major. It's the shit. While in college, with some awesome luck, I also was introduced to programming, which also is, well, the shit. I know R quite well, SAS roughly, and am familar with HTML (e.g. this website), CSS, and Javascript. I'm into data visualization and statistics.
						<br><br>
						As a hobby, I have fun making art. I like trees. I enjoy playing Scrabble, Settlers of Catan, and poker (Texas hold'em). I also like to boulder (rock climbing, but without ropes and only 14 or so feet high). I loved Arrested Development. I listen to a lot of audiobooks.
						<br><br>
						Why I love graphs: Graphs can show so much! Node and line sizes, colors, shapes, and placements (over time!) can all tell the stories of distinct variables. It's pretty hard to see trends that live in these multiple dimensions while staring at spreadsheets. So - especially when you can't understand the data you're working with in one gulp - don't just stare at spreadsheets: make pretty pictures, too! Infographics rock. (Why do our government's fiscal budgets contain only text?! Hundreds of pages of pure pdf text is painful to digest - I've tried). Anyways.
						<br><br>
						Life goals of mine:
						<ul class="reglist">
							<li class="regitem"><em>1</em> Create a website that initially just has a lot of informative graphs about government spending (primarily US), but eventually offers 'drill-down' interactive capabilities, well written explanations, and links to more information.</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>2</em> Read more books on theoretical and applications-based statistics.</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>3</em> Learn more about machine learning; win (or nearly win) a Kaggle contest (or equivalent, since there aren't many nowadays).</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>4</em> Write a small booklet on some statist-y thing, and make it freely available.</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>5</em> Work part time, or soley on my own projects.</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>6</em> Travel (one can program anywhere!)</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>7</em> Get good at Javascript and Ruby on Rails.</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>8</em> Make a positive difference. Epsilon counts, but the bigger the better.</li>
							<li class="regitem"><em>9</em> Smile more.</li>
